# WT Tech Tree (Static Demo)

This is a static, GitHub Pages–optimized build of a War Thunder–style tech tree browser.

## Local dev
Just open `index.html` in your browser. No server needed (all data is embedded).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Push this folder to a public GitHub repository.
2. Ensure the GitHub Actions workflow exists at `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
3. In the repo settings, enable **Pages** and use **GitHub Actions** as the source.
4. Every push to `main` will auto-deploy your site.

## Notes
- Image URLs point to War Thunder wiki thumbnails where provided; others use a placeholder.
- This is an unofficial fan demo and not affiliated with Gaijin.
